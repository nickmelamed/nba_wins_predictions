# NBA Wins Predictions 

## Motivation and Overview

Since this section is quite long, please use this written report linked [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15BMeZqaSRPMMUwG2c5p8phO5q_jh_R58JpLTJ4HDrRk/edit?usp=sharing).

This report includes all visualizations and concluding remarks (both of which are also included in the main analysis file). 

## Data

We will be using two datasets, the first one being a collection of team statistics from the 2022-2023 NBA season (`2023_teams.csv`), the second being a collection of individual player statistics from the 2022-2023 NBA season (`2023_players.csv`). 

Both of these datsets come courtesy of NBAstuffer.com, a NBA statistic aggregator. The links for the respective datasets are [here](https://www.nbastuffer.com/2022-2023-nba-team-stats/) and [here](https://www.nbastuffer.com/2022-2023-nba-player-stats/). Note that you should be on the "Regular Season" tab to access the correct CSV files.
